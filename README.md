Chemical demand prediction
Forecast demand for a chemical production plant

About
The client is into the chemical industry business. They produce and distribute various types of chemicals to the market.

The dataset consists of the daily average demand for one type of chemical (in Kilo Gallons) across multiple markets of a country.

Objective
The client would like to use the appropriate demand forecasting technique/s to help them predict the daily demand of the chemical, with high accuracy. This demand prediction will help them efficiently manage their production capacities and distribution logistics.

You need to assess what data is available and perform some exploratory and descriptive analytics to identify interesting and useful patterns, trends, and insights. Also, build appropriate predictive model/s on the data.

Participants should be able to :

Clean the data
perform EDA and Vizualizations
build model/s (time seires)
evaluate the model
provide business insights from the model

File descriptions

DemandSubmission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format; but the predicted demand values are randomly set to 25.5 each...i.e, incorrect.. :)
Data fields
ID - date
mean_demand_kiloGallon - average demand of the chemical across various markets in the country
